# Limits in AWS CodePipeline<a name="limits"></a>

The following table lists current limits in AWS CodePipeline\. For information about structural requirements, see [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\. For information about limits that can be changed, see [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline)\.

**Note**  
Limits that appear in both this table and in the [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline) table are configurable limits\. All other limits in this table are not configurable\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
|  Maximum number of total pipelines per AWS Region in an AWS account  |  300  | 
|  Maximum number of pipelines per AWS Region with change detection set to periodically check for source changes  |  60  Instead of using periodic checks, configure your pipeline to use the recommended change detection method for your source type\. For example, configure your AWS CodeCommit pipeline to use Amazon CloudWatch Events for change detection\. See [ Change Detection Methods Used to Start Pipelines Automatically](pipelines-about-starting.md#change-detection-methods) for instructions for your source type\.   | 
|  Number of stages in a pipeline  |  Minimum of 2, maximum of 10  | 
|  Number of actions in a stage  |  Minimum of 1, maximum of 50  | 
| Maximum number of custom actions per AWS Region in an AWS account | 50 | 
| Maximum number of parallel actions in a stage | 50 | 
| Maximum number of sequential actions in a stage | 50 | 
| Maximum number of webhooks per AWS Region in an AWS account | 300 | 
|  Length of time before an action times out  |  Approval action: 7 days AWS CloudFormation deployment action: 3 days CodeBuild build action and test action: 8 hours CodeDeploy and CodeDeploy ECS \(blue/green\) deployment actions: 5 days AWS Lambda invoke action: 1 hour  CodePipeline waits one hour to determine if a Lambda invoke action failed\. If the action times out, CodePipeline sets the invoke action state to failed\. AWS Lambda has a maximum execution duration per request limit\. This limit is set in AWS Lambda \(see [AWS Lambda Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)\) and does not affect the action timeout in CodePipeline\.  Amazon S3 deployment action: 20 minutes All other actions: 1 hour  | 
| Maximum number of months that pipeline execution history information is retained | 12 |

| Maximum size of artifacts in a source stage |  Artifacts stored in Amazon S3 buckets: 3 GB Artifacts stored in CodeCommit or GitHub repositories: 1 GB Exception: If you are using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 512 MB\. Exception: If you are using AWS CloudFormation to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 256 MB\.  | 
| Maximum size of input artifacts for AWS CloudFormation actions | 256 MB | 
| Uniqueness of names |  Within a single AWS account, each pipeline you create in an AWS Region must have a unique name\. You can reuse names for pipelines in different AWS Regions\.  Stage names must be unique within a pipeline\. Action names must be unique within a stage\.  | 
| Characters allowed in pipeline name |  Pipeline names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.   | 
| Characters allowed in stage name |  Stage names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  |

| Characters allowed in action types |  Action type names cannot exceed 25 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in partner action names | Partner action names must follow the same naming conventions and restrictions as other action names in CodePipeline\. Specifically, they cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\.The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\.The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\.The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\.Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\. | 
|  Maximum size of the JSON object that can be stored in the `ParameterOverrides` property  | For a CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider, the ParameterOverrides property is used to store a JSON object that specifies values for the AWS CloudFormation template configuration file\. There is a maximum size limit of 1 kilobyte for the JSON object that can be stored in the ParameterOverrides property\. | 
|  Maximum size of the image definitions JSON file used in pipelines deploying Amazon ECS containers and images  | 100 KB | 
| Pipeline tags | Tags are case sensitive\. Maximum of 50 per resource\. |
