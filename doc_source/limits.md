# Quotas in AWS CodePipeline<a name="limits"></a>

The following table lists current quotas in AWS CodePipeline\. For information about structural requirements, see [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\. For information about quotas that can be changed, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline)\.

**Note**  
The quotas that appear in both this table and in the [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline) table can be configured\. All other limits in this table are not configurable\.

The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  |

The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in partner action names | Partner action names must follow the same naming conventions and restrictions as other action names in CodePipeline\. Specifically, they cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\.The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\.The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\.The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\.Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\. | 
| Characters allowed in pipeline name |  Pipeline names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.   | 
| Characters allowed in stage name |  Stage names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
|  Characters allowed in the action configuration key \(for example, the CodeBuild configuration keys are `ProjectName`, `PrimarySource`, and `EnvironmentVariables`\)  | 50 characters | 
|  Characters allowed in the action configuration value \(for example, the value of the `RepositoryName` configuration in the CodeCommit action configuration should be less than 1000 characters:  `"RepositoryName": "my-repo-name-less-than-1000-characters"`\)  | 1000 characters | 
|  Length of time before an action times out  |  Approval action: 7 days AWS CloudFormation deployment action: 3 days CodeBuild build action and test action: 8 hours CodeDeploy and CodeDeploy ECS \(blue/green\) deployment actions: 5 days AWS Lambda invoke action: 1 hour  CodePipeline waits one hour to determine if a Lambda invoke action failed\. If the action times out, CodePipeline sets the invoke action state to failed\. AWS Lambda has a maximum execution duration per request limit\. This limit is set in AWS Lambda \(see [AWS Lambda Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)\) and does not affect the action timeout in CodePipeline\.  Amazon S3 deployment action: 20 minutes All other actions: 1 hour  The Amazon ECS deployment action timeout is configurable up to one hour \(the default timeout\)\.   | 
| Maximum number of custom actions per AWS Region in an AWS account | 50 | 
| Maximum number of months that pipeline execution history information is retained | 12 | 
| Maximum number of parallel actions in a stage | 50 | 
|  Maximum number of pipelines set to polling for source changes, per AWS Region  |  60  We recommend you configure your pipeline to use event\-based change detection, such as webhooks or Amazon CloudWatch Events\. See [ Change Detection Methods to Start Pipelines](pipelines-about-starting.md#change-detection-methods) for instructions for your source type\.1   | 
|  Maximum number of total pipelines per AWS Region in an AWS account  |  300  Pipelines configured for either polling or event\-based change detection are counted toward this quota\.   |

| Maximum number of webhooks per AWS Region in an AWS account | 300 | 
| Maximum size of artifacts in a source stage |  Artifacts stored in Amazon S3 buckets: 3 GB Artifacts stored in CodeCommit or GitHub repositories: 1 GB Exception: If you are using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 512 MB\. Exception: If you are using AWS CloudFormation to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 256 MB\. Exception: If you are using the `CodeDeployToECS` action to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 3 MB\.  | 
|  Maximum size of the image definitions JSON file used in pipelines deploying Amazon ECS containers and images  | 100 KB |

|  Maximum size of the JSON object that can be stored in the `ParameterOverrides` property  | For a CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider, the ParameterOverrides property is used to store a JSON object that specifies values for the AWS CloudFormation template configuration file\. There is a maximum size limit of 1 kilobyte for the JSON object that can be stored in the ParameterOverrides property\. | 
|  Number of actions in a stage  |  Minimum of 1, maximum of 50  | 
|  Number of stages in a pipeline  |  Minimum of 2, maximum of 50  | 
| Pipeline tags | Tags are case sensitive\. Maximum of 50 per resource\. | 
| Pipeline tag key names |  Any combination of Unicode letters, numbers, spaces, and allowed characters in UTF\-8 between 1 and 128 characters in length\. Allowed characters are \+ \- = \. \_ : / @ Tag key names must be unique, and each key can haveonly one value\. A tag cannot:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/limits.html)  | 
| Pipeline tag values |  Any combination of Unicode letters, numbers, spaces, and allowed characters in UTF\-8 between 1 and 256 characters in length\. Allowed characters are \+ \- = \. \_ : / @ A key can have only one value, but many keys can have the same value\. A tag cannot: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/limits.html)  | 
| Uniqueness of names |  Within a single AWS account, each pipeline you create in an AWS Region must have a unique name\. You can reuse names for pipelines in different AWS Regions\.  Stage names must be unique within a pipeline\. Action names must be unique within a stage\.  | 
| Variable quotas |  There is a maximum size limit of 122880 bytes for all output variables combined for a particular action\. There is a maximum size limit of 100 KB for the total resolved action configuration for a particular action\. Output variable names are case sensitive\. Namespaces are case sensitive\.
